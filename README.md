Hello. This is a prototype application for a car accident detection system which uses an accelerometer attached to a PSoC 4 BLE board that is capable of precisely detecting a sudden change in acceleration (mostly ignoring false alarms, such as sudden breaking or accidentally hitting an object while parking) and sending, via Bluetooth, a signal to the user's phone. From there, the phone would construct the message including the coordinates of the location at which the accident took place, and then send this message to a list of contacts, the members of which could then subsequently call and inform the authorities of the unfortunate incident.
